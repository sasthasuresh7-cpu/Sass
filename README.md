 




The focal entity, ED&F Man Volcafe Ltd (Volcafe Brasil Ltda – MVB), is the Brazil arm of Volcafe Ltd, a globally recognized coffee trading company headquartered in Winterthur, Zurich. Volcafe is one of the world’s largest traders of Arabica and Robusta coffee, operating an extensive global network of buying and selling offices across major coffee-producing regions and serving clients worldwide. The Brazil entity operates as Volcafe’s local sourcing and trading company in the world’s largest coffee-producing country, facilitating procurement, quality control, and supply chain management of Brazilian Arabica and Conilon (Robusta) coffees for the group. The counterparty in the transactions is Volcafe Ltd or its group entities, indicating that the transfers are internal, group-level fund movements aligned with centralized treasury, trade settlement, and operational funding requirements within the Volcafe group structure.


The reviewed transaction pertains to multiple inter-company fund transfers amounting to USD 30,400,000 executed across 10 instances between 04-Feb-2025 and 12-Nov-2025. The transfers are identified as internal group movements between ED & F Man group entities, specifically involving ED & F Man Volcafe Brasil Ltda and ED & F Man Brazil Volcafe, with the nature of transaction recorded as “Inter Company/Group transfer – 100%”. The remitter and beneficiary fields are marked as not applicable, indicating internal treasury movement rather than third-party settlement.



The review period reflects 4 inward remittances received by the focal entity DYM Metal Co. Ltd. from Goodsmooth International Limited through banking channels in USD, aggregating to USD 416,942.36 between 03 Nov 2025 and 04 Dec 2025. The OBI references indicate payments made for goods, specifically relating to iron and steel flat-rolled alloy steel products (zinc/galvanized coated sheets of width 600 mm or more). The pattern of transactions is consistent in nature, limited in count, and aligned with the stated line of business of both parties—where the counterparty trades in steel products and the focal entity deals in materials and equipment used in insulation and waterproofing installations. The remittances appear to represent genuine trade payments routed through proper banking channels, with no unusual spikes, structuring, or deviation in transaction behavior observed during the review period.


Focal Entity Profile – Ningbo Alto Nanog Technology Co. Ltd (CN)
The focal entity is based in Yinzhou District, Ningbo, China and operates in the domain of base metals and cermet articles, including titanium, copper and related metal products, waste and scrap. This indicates involvement in metal processing, trading, or manufacturing of metal components/raw materials. Ningbo being a major port and industrial hub further supports the likelihood that the entity is engaged in export-oriented metal trade or supply of metal inputs to overseas manufacturers.
Counterparty Profile – Tong Lung Philippines Metal Industry Co., Inc. (PH)
The counterparty is located in Subic Bay Freeport Zone, Philippines and is described as a manufacturer and designer of residential and commercial door hardware. This business requires large quantities of processed metals and metal components such as steel, brass, copper alloys and other metal inputs used in locks, hinges, handles and hardware assemblies. Being in a Freeport zone also indicates import of raw materials/components for manufacturing and export.



During the period 14-Nov-25 to 18-Nov-25, a total of 3 transactions amounting to USD 109,551.60 were observed between the focal entity Ningbo Alto Nanog Technology Co. Ltd (CN) and the counterparty Tong Lung Philippines Metal Industry Co., Inc. (PH). The funds were both remitted to and received from the counterparty, indicating a two-way commercial settlement pattern rather than a unilateral transfer of funds.
The counterparty operates as a metal door hardware manufacturer in the Subic Bay Freeport Zone, while the focal entity deals in base metals and metal articles including copper and related materials. This aligns with a genuine trade cycle where the focal entity is likely supplying metal raw materials/components required for manufacturing, and the reverse flow of funds may relate to settlement for finished/semi-finished goods, pricing adjustments, or commercial reconciliations within the supply chain.
The transactions are routed through recognized banking channels (Standard Chartered Bank – Hong Kong), denominated in USD, which is typical for cross-border trade settlements between China and the Philippines. The transaction value and frequency appear consistent with commercial trade activity between a metal supplier and a hardware manufacturer.
Overall, the observed activity is commensurate with the stated line of business of both entities and reflects a plausible, ongoing trade relationship supported by reciprocal payments and standard international trade practices.
