A comprehensive review was conducted on the focal entity Zhou LiJuan and the counterparty Zhou Jie. Both individuals could not be conclusively verified through public-domain information, and no business profile, adverse media, or regulatory concerns were identified for either party. Despite the lack of publicly available information, the OBI (Originator to Beneficiary Information) provided alongside the transactional data clearly states that the purpose of the payments is “gift / gift for daughter.” This purpose aligns with the observed pattern of transfers and is consistent with personal financial support rather than commercial activity.

Further, a name match is evident between the focal and the counterparty, which strongly suggests a probable familial relationship—likely parent and child or close relatives. In such cases, financial transfers of modest value are common and fall within the scope of normal personal remittances. During the period 18 August 2025 to 24 September 2025, the focal remitted an aggregate amount of USD 50,000 to the counterparty. This value is considered moderate and proportionate for family-related gifting, particularly when the purpose is explicitly mentioned and supported through the OBI narrative.

No red flags have been identified in the transactional behaviour. There is no indication of structuring, unusual cash activity, third-party involvement, or attempts to obscure the source or destination of funds. The only Detection Scenario (DS) triggered is EN–FTN Recurring Originator and Beneficiary, which was generated due to the repeated transfers between the same two parties within a short duration. This scenario typically signals patterns that may warrant closer examination; however, in this instance, the recurrence is reasonably justified by the personal nature of the relationship and the clearly disclosed purpose of the funds. The amounts involved are neither fragmented nor suggestive of an attempt to evade reporting thresholds. Instead, they reflect legitimate familial support.

Given the absence of high-risk indicators, the clarity of the transaction purpose, the familial linkage inferred from name similarity, and the relatively low transaction values, the recurring activity does not present any suspicion. Therefore, the Detection Scenario is appropriately mitigated, and the case is assessed as risk-irrelevant at this stage. No further review, monitoring escalation, or enhanced due diligence is recommended.
