The focal entity has been identified as an individual, and a review of the transactional activity confirms that 100% of the transactions are interpersonal in nature. Between 18 August 2025 and 22 September 2025, the focal remitted a cumulative amount of USD 19,000, which falls within reasonable limits for individual-to-individual transfers. The Originator to Beneficiary Information (OBI) clearly states the purpose of the transactions as “MYSELF / FAMILY MAINTENANCE OF RELATIVES,” thereby providing transparency and a legitimate explanation for the fund movements. Although the transactions involve jurisdictions categorized as high-risk, namely South Africa and Turkey, this alone does not raise concern, as it is common for individuals to conduct personal transfers across multiple countries for familial support and maintenance. No unusual transactional behavior, structuring, or inconsistencies have been observed in terms of frequency, amount, or purpose. Additionally, the transaction values are minimal and consistent with typical personal remittances rather than any form of commercial or suspicious activity. It is also noted that this detection scenario has been triggered for the first time for the focal, with no adverse history or prior alerts identified. Based on the overall assessment and in line with a risk-based approach, the activity is assessed as low risk, and the case is therefore considered risk irrelevant at this juncture and recommended for closure.
