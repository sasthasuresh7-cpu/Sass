Detection Scenarios (List Triggered DS):
The detection scenario FTN – Recurring Originator and Beneficiary was triggered due to multiple outward remittances conducted by the focal entity to the same counterparty within a short period. The scenario was generated based on the recurring nature of the transactions rather than any deviation in transaction behavior or purpose.
Justification for CP Selection (If any):
The counterparty Ruslan Trading Company Limited, Vietnam, was selected for review as it is the sole beneficiary of the remitted funds during the review period. The recurring transactions and high cumulative value warranted a closer assessment of the counterparty relationship and transaction rationale.
Profile: Main Entity & Counterparty Details / Relationship:
The focal entity, Cart Tire Co., Ltd, is a Cambodia-based company primarily engaged in the manufacturing of tires, inner tubes, and rubber-related automotive products. The entity operates from Sihanoukville Special Economic Zone and maintains its banking relationship with Advanced Bank of Asia Limited (Cambodia). Public domain information indicates that the company is well-established in the manufacturing sector, with export-oriented operations.
The counterparty, Ruslan Trading Company Limited, is located in Vietnam and banks with Asia Commercial Bank (Vietnam). The entity is engaged in wholesale trading and industrial machinery and equipment, with specific involvement in the export and trading of carbon black and related industrial inputs, which are commonly used in tire and rubber manufacturing.
The relationship between the focal entity and the counterparty appears to be commercial in nature, aligned with supplier–buyer or trade-related activity within the rubber and tire manufacturing supply chain.
Transaction Analysis / Trend & Pattern:
During the review period from 19-Sep-2025 to 03-Oct-2025, the focal entity remitted three transactions totaling USD 1,794,736.00 to the counterparty. All transactions were conducted in USD and followed a consistent transaction pattern with no unusual structuring, layering, or deviation in frequency or value.
The transaction behavior is consistent with trade-related payments, considering the focal entity’s manufacturing profile and the counterparty’s involvement in industrial materials relevant to tire production. The OBI/BBI references support the legitimacy of the payments and indicate a clear commercial purpose. No cash involvement or third-party intermediaries were observed.
Red Flags (If any):
No adverse red flags were identified during the review. Although the transaction value is high, it is considered reasonable given the focal entity’s scale of operations and export-oriented manufacturing business. The geographic corridor between Cambodia and Vietnam is also consistent with regional trade practices.
Watchlist Screening (Accuity / Kharon / World Check) & Adverse Hits (If any):
Sanctions and adverse media screening conducted on both the focal entity and the counterparty did not result in any matches. No associations with sanctioned individuals, entities, or negative news were identified.
Prior RR (If any):
A prior review is noted in the system; however, no adverse outcomes or escalations were recorded. The current activity does not indicate any material change from previously observed behavior.
IIG / RFI Response (If any):
Not applicable. No additional information was required as sufficient details were available from transaction records, public domain sources, and OBI/BBI references.
Final Recommendation / Conclusion:
Based on the overall assessment, the transactions appear to be legitimate trade-related payments consistent with the focal entity’s business profile and the counterparty’s line of business. The detection scenario was triggered due to recurring transactions; however, the purpose, counterparties, transaction pattern, and supporting information are well identified and reasonable.
Accordingly, the detection scenario is considered mitigated, and no further escalation or enhanced due diligence is recommended at this stage.
