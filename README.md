Based on the public-domain profile, Nocera Inc. is a U.S.-based aquaculture and sustainable seafood technology company specializing in the design, manufacture, and deployment of land-based Recirculating Aquaculture Systems (RAS), along with providing fish-farming consultancy, seafood trading, and related operational services. In contrast, the focal entity operates within the Administrative and Support Services sector, offering a broad range of business support, management assistance, and operational facilitation services to commercial clients. Given the distinct yet complementary nature of both entities, it is plausible that the focal’s remittances to Nocera Inc. relate to commercially legitimate engagements, such as procurement of aquaculture-related equipment or technology on behalf of a client, settlement of service fees for consultancy or project-support functions provided by Nocera, or administrative coordination of a larger seafood or sustainability-oriented project in which the focal serves as an intermediary. The focal’s business model typically involves assisting organizations with operational, procurement, or project-management activities; therefore, payments to Nocera Inc. may represent vendor settlement, outsourced service payments, facilitation of a client project, or reimbursement for equipment or services procured. Overall, the relationship between the focal and Nocera Inc. appears consistent with a commercial service-provider and specialized-technology supplier relationship, wherein the focal acts as an administrative or operational enabler while Nocera delivers the core aquaculture products or expertise required for the underlying business activity.
