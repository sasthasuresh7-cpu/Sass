1. Focal Entity & Counterparty Profile

The focal entity, CALPERS WWW/SCR, is located and banking in the United States. Publicly available information identifies CALPERS as a pension and retirement fund administrator that provides retirement and health-related benefits primarily for public employees and their families.

For the review period from 19-Aug-2024 to 19-Sep-2024, the focal entity conducted 100% interpersonal transactions, amounting to USD 1,381,644.77, across three different dates. The transactions were primarily routed as round-dollar payments.

The counterparty (EN-HR Trans-Ben/Rec/Orig/Send DIF) is also based in the United States. Available information suggests the counterparty is associated with HR-related disbursements, employee benefits, and record-keeping transactions, which aligns with the focal’s functional profile.

2. Transaction Analysis

The focal entity has conducted a series of high-value, round-dollar transactions. Such round-dollar payments can occasionally trigger alerts; however, based on the business nature of CALPERS and the characteristics of the transactions, the activity appears consistent with:

periodic retirement/benefits disbursements,

inter-account fund allocations, and

internal reconciliation or payroll-related processes.


A review of historic patterns indicates that the focal entity frequently conducts fund movements between related accounts for operational, administrative, and record-keeping purposes. This supports the legitimacy of the current activity.

The DS alert for Recurring Originator/Beneficiary (ORB) events was triggered for the current set of transactions. However, both parties are based in the USA (low-risk jurisdiction), and the financial behaviour is in line with a high-capacity institution managing recurring inflows and outflows for benefit distribution. Thus, the recurring nature of these payments does not raise concern.

No unusual structuring, layering behaviour, third-party involvement, or deviations from expected transaction patterns were observed.

3. Red Flag Check & Adverse Media Review

A full red-flag assessment and adverse media check were completed.

No negative news, compliance issues, sanctions exposure, or financial misconduct could be linked to either the focal or the counterparty.

No additional concerns surfaced during the extended search.



---

4. Conclusion & Recommendation

The associated alert events were reviewed thoroughly in the context of the entities involved, their business profiles, and the transactional behaviour.

The activity does not exhibit unusual or suspicious characteristics.

The round-dollar nature and recurring originator/beneficiary pattern are consistent with the operational requirements of a regulated pension and benefits administrator.

All risk scenarios associated with the detection have been adequately mitigated.


Based on the overall review and analysis, the case is concluded as Risk Irrelevant and may be closed.
