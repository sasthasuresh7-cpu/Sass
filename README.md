Although the red flag of inconsistent domicile is noted, it is considered adequately mitigated as the focal is an individual, and it is common for individuals to maintain bank accounts across different countries for personal or family-related purposes. The transaction amounts are reasonable, the pattern is consistent with personal remittances, and the purpose is supported by OBI references. No additional risk indicators were identified.


The alert was triggered under the EN-Trans – Round Amounts (Wire) detection scenario due to the focal entity, GivePower Kenya, receiving multiple transactions from the same counterparty in round-dollar amounts over a short period. Upon review, it is noted that the transactions form part of a recurring funding pattern commonly observed in non-profit organizations.
GivePower Kenya is identified as a non-profit organization operating in Kenya, primarily engaged in clean water initiatives, renewable energy solutions, and community-focused sustainability projects. The counterparty, GivePower Foundation, is a registered non-profit organization based in the United States and functions as the parent or funding entity, supporting global operational activities through structured fund disbursements.
Based on public domain research, naming conventions, and operational alignment, it is evident that both entities belong to the same organizational group and share an established business relationship. The flow of funds from the counterparty to the focal entity is consistent with a donor-funded operational model, where the foundation provides financial support to its regional operating arms.
A detailed review of the transaction amounts, dates, and flow of funds indicates that the transfers were conducted on nearby dates and predominantly in round-dollar values. However, such structuring is common for inter-group funding, charitable grants, and internal budgeting purposes, and does not, in itself, indicate suspicious activity. The OBI/BBI references clearly specify the purpose of the transactions, providing transparency and justification for the fund movements.
No unusual transaction behavior, unexplained fund flows, or deviations from the expected activity profile were identified. The transaction volumes and values are consistent with the operational and funding requirements of a non-profit organization. Additionally, no prior risk-relevant cases were identified for either the focal entity or the counterparty. Open-source checks did not reveal any adverse media, regulatory concerns, or negative reputational findings related to the entities involved.
Although Kenya is classified as a higher-risk jurisdiction, the involvement of this country is aligned with the focal entity’s established area of operations. The jurisdictional risk is mitigated by the legitimate charitable purpose, inter-group relationship, clear source of funds, and absence of any adverse indicators.
Conclusion:
Based on the comprehensive review of transaction details, public domain information, and the established relationship between the entities, the activity appears legitimate and consistent with the stated business profile. The detection scenario has been adequately mitigated, and the case is assessed as risk irrelevant. Accordingly, the alert is recommended for closure with no further action at this time.
