Relationship Between Focal and Counterparty:
HC Cross Border Limited operates as a business services and administrative support entity, primarily facilitating cross-border operational requirements, procurement support, corporate coordination, and ancillary management services for international clients. Nocera Inc, by contrast, is a U.S.-based aquaculture and sustainable seafood technology company engaged in manufacturing land-based Recirculating Aquaculture Systems (RAS), providing aquaculture consultancy, and trading in seafood products. Given the distinct roles of both entities, the relationship between them is most plausibly commercial and service-driven, where HC Cross Border Limited may be acting as an intermediary or service facilitator for clients seeking technological solutions, seafood supply arrangements, or aquaculture-related services from Nocera Inc. The funds remitted by the focal could therefore represent vendor payments for goods or equipment procured, settlement of consultancy or project-support fees, or reimbursement for aquaculture-related services where Nocera acts as the specialized supplier. Considering the focal’s business model of enabling cross-border transactions and administrative coordination, and the counterparty’s niche aquaculture expertise, the interaction appears aligned with a legitimate business-to-business relationship, wherein HC Cross Border Limited supports procurement or project facilitation while Nocera Inc provides the required technical products or industry-specific services.
