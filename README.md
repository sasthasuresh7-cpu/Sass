Justification for CP Selection (If any):
The counterparty IMPERIAL STAR SOLAR (CAMBODIA) CO., LTD was selected for review due to repeated high-value wire transactions and round-amount payment patterns received from the focal entity IC STAR SOLAR (USA) LLC during the review period.
Profile – Main Entity & Counterparty Details / Relationship:
The focal entity IC STAR SOLAR (USA) LLC operates in the renewable energy sector, primarily engaged in solar equipment and module-related activities. Public domain review indicates that IC STAR SOLAR (USA) LLC and IMPERIAL STAR SOLAR (USA) LLP appear to be associated entities, based on closely aligned naming conventions, similar business operations, and shared industry focus.
The counterparty IMPERIAL STAR SOLAR (CAMBODIA) CO., LTD, identified from public domain sources, is a manufacturer of photovoltaic (PV) solar products, including high-efficiency solar cells, silicon wafers, and solar modules. The similarity in entity names and alignment in business activities suggests that the Cambodian entity operates as part of the same corporate group as the US entity, with different jurisdictions supporting different operational functions (manufacturing vs. commercial/financial operations).
Transaction Analysis / Trend & Pattern:
During the review period from 15-Sep-2025 to 15-Dec-2025, the focal entity remitted 19 wire transactions totaling USD 5,929,200 to the counterparty. The transactions were processed via JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. (US) and Advanced Bank of Asia Limited (KH). The OBI/BBI details explicitly state “Payment for Solar Module”, which is consistent with the declared line of business of both entities. The recurring nature and round-amount structure of the payments align with commercial trade settlement patterns between related group entities.
Red Flags (If any):
No material red flags were identified beyond the system-generated alerts related to recurring transactions and round-amount wires.
Watchlist Screening (Accuity / Kharon / World-Check) & Adverse Hits (If any):
Watchlist and adverse media screening conducted on the focal entity and counterparty did not return any sanctions, PEP, or adverse media matches.
Prior RR (If any):
No prior risk review records of concern were identified.
IIG/RFI Response (If any):
Not applicable.
Final Recommendation / Conclusion:
Based on the entity relationship analysis, transaction behavior, clearly stated OBI purpose, and alignment with the entities’ legitimate solar manufacturing and distribution activities, the detected scenarios are assessed as explainable commercial activity between related group entities. Although Cambodia is considered a higher-risk jurisdiction, the risk is mitigated by transparent transaction purpose, identifiable entities, and absence of adverse information. Accordingly, the alerts are assessed as risk-irrelevant, and the case is recommended for closure.
