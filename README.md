1. Focal Entity & Counterparty Profile

The focal entity, CALPERS WWW/SCR, is located and banking in the United States. Publicly available information identifies CALPERS as a pension and retirement fund administrator that provides retirement and health-related benefits primarily for public employees and their families.

For the review period from 19-Aug-2024 to 19-Sep-2024, the focal entity conducted 100% interpersonal transactions, amounting to USD 1,381,644.77, across three different dates. The transactions were primarily routed as round-dollar payments.

The counterparty (EN-HR Trans-Ben/Rec/Orig/Send DIF) is also based in the United States. Available information suggests the counterparty is associated with HR-related disbursements, employee benefits, and record-keeping transactions, which aligns with the focal’s functional profile.

2. Transaction Analysis

The focal entity has conducted a series of high-value, round-dollar transactions. Such round-dollar payments can occasionally trigger alerts; however, based on the business nature of CALPERS and the characteristics of the transactions, the activity appears consistent with:

periodic retirement/benefits disbursements,

inter-account fund allocations, and

internal reconciliation or payroll-related processes.


A review of historic patterns indicates that the focal entity frequently conducts fund movements between related accounts for operational, administrative, and record-keeping purposes. This supports the legitimacy of the current activity.

The DS alert for Recurring Originator/Beneficiary (ORB) events was triggered for the current set of transactions. However, both parties are based in the USA (low-risk jurisdiction), and the financial behaviour is in line with a high-capacity institution managing recurring inflows and outflows for benefit distribution. Thus, the recurring nature of these payments does not raise concern.

No unusual structuring, layering behaviour, third-party involvement, or deviations from expected transaction patterns were observed.

3. Red Flag Check & Adverse Media Review

A full red-flag assessment and adverse media check were completed.

No negative news, compliance issues, sanctions exposure, or financial misconduct could be linked to either the focal or the counterparty.

No additional concerns surfaced during the extended search.

4. Conclusion & Recommendation

The associated alert events were reviewed thoroughly in the context of the entities involved, their business profiles, and the transactional behaviour.

The activity does not exhibit unusual or suspicious characteristics.

The focal entity QUESERÍA DOS LAGUNAS S.A. de C.V., incorporated in Mexico, was identified through public domain sources as a company engaged in the manufacturing, processing, and distribution of dairy products, primarily cheese and related food items. The Spanish term “Quesería” directly refers to a cheese or dairy-processing facility, which aligns with the company’s operational nature as a food and dairy manufacturer. The counterparty QUESERIA DOS LAGUNAS carries the same naming structure, indicating that both entities belong to the same corporate group. Based on this and the observed payment pattern, the relationship is classified as inter-company.

A total of 12 outward remittances were initiated by the focal from 24 March 2025 to 03 November 2025, amounting to USD 1,726,000. All transactions were routed to the counterparty entity under the same corporate name, further reinforcing the intra-group nature of the transfers. The OBI reference “PAGO DE INTERESES O COMISIONES”, which translates to “Payment of interest or commissions/fees,” provides a clear explanation of the payment purpose. This indicates that the remittances relate to financial obligations such as inter-company interest settlements, fee payments, or internal accounting adjustments commonly observed within multinational or multi-entity corporate structures.

Despite the relatively high cumulative transaction value, the focal entity reports an annual revenue of approximately USD 78.31 million, suggesting that the remitted amounts are not disproportionate and fall within a reasonable operational scale for a company of this size. The transaction trend also shows no rapid circularity, irregular spikes, or deviation from normal inter-company financial activity.

Mexico is acknowledged as a high-risk jurisdiction, primarily due to elevated financial crime exposure and regulatory vulnerabilities. However, in this case, the following mitigating factors significantly reduce the overall risk:

The focal entity is conclusively identified through public domain sources.

The counterparty shares the same corporate name, confirming a legitimate inter-company relationship.

100% of the transactions fall under the inter-company category.

A clear purpose of payment (“interest or commission payments”) is established.

The transaction amounts are proportionate when compared to the company’s annual revenue.

No adverse media, sanctions concerns, or inconsistencies were observed.


Based on the above, while the jurisdictional risk remains inherently elevated, the overall transactional risk is considered mitigated due to clear entity identification, legitimate business purpose, proportionality of transaction amounts, and a fully established inter-company relationship. No suspicious indicators were identified that would warrant further escalation.

KEM Tech is engaged in the manufacturing and development of secondary (rechargeable) battery components—specifically prismatic and circular can battery parts—as well as IR filter components for cameras and electronic devices. The company focuses on supplying essential parts for future-oriented industries within the global electronics and battery sectors.






The focal entity, Blue Import and Export Inc. (United States), is engaged in the import and export of fish and seafood products. The counterparty, Fujian Rongjiang Import & Export Co. Ltd. (China), operates in a similar industry, dealing in the import and export of aquatic products, seafood, and processed food items. Given the alignment of their business lines within the global seafood supply chain, it is reasonable to infer a commercial trading relationship between the two entities. Blue Import and Export Inc. likely sources seafood or related processed products from Fujian Rongjiang Import & Export as part of its procurement and distribution operations, or alternatively, supplies goods to them depending on market demand. The nature of both entities’ operations supports the conclusion that the transactions represent legitimate cross-border trade activities within the seafood import-export sector.


The focal entity, Blue Import and Export Inc. (US), initiated an outward remittance of USD 530,000 to Fujian Rongjiang Import & Export Co. located in China through China Construction Bank Corporation (CN) during the period from 19-Aug-25 to 12-Sep-25. Both entities, based on their business names and publicly available information, operate within the international trade/import–export sector, suggesting a commercial trading relationship. The nature of the payment—an outward USD remittance to a Chinese export company—is consistent with international procurement or settlement of trade invoices for goods sourced from China.
