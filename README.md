• Detection Scenarios (List Triggered DS):

The Detection Scenario triggered is FTN – Recurring Originator and Beneficiary, as the focal entity has initiated multiple transfers to the same counterparty within a short time frame.


---

• Justification for CP Selection (If any):

The case was selected for review due to repeated transactions to a single counterparty and exposure to high-risk jurisdictions (Uganda and Thailand) involved in the transaction trail.


---

• Profile – Main Entity & Counterparty details / Relationship:

Focal Entity: Impiger Technologies Private Limited
The entity is identified from the public domain and operates in the software development, IT consulting, and digital transformation services sector.

Counterparty: Essen Technologies
The counterparty is identified from the public domain and operates in the information technology and computer services sector, including computer system recovery and software installation-related services.

Relationship:
Based on the nature of business, the relationship appears to be B2B IT service-based, where payments are aligned with service-related deliverables.


---

• Transaction Analysis / Trend & Pattern:

Between 15 August and 08 September, the focal has remitted a total of USD 763,136 to the same counterparty through multiple transactions.
Although the value is comparatively high, the transaction size remains within the operational and financial capacity of the focal entity.
The pattern of repeated transfers resulted in the FTN Recurring DS trigger. However, the payments are consistent with known business activity and are aligned with the profile and line of business of both entities.


---

• Red Flags (If any):

High-Risk Jurisdiction exposure: Uganda and Thailand.
However, this does not raise concern as both entities are clearly identified from public domain records, and the line of business aligns with legitimate cross-border IT service operations.

No additional red flags observed.


---

• Watchlist Screening (Acuity / Kharon / World Check) & Adverse Hits (If any):

Both focal and counterparty entities screened across Acuity / Kharon / World-Check.
No adverse, sanctions, or negative media hits identified.


---

• Prior RR (If any):

No previous Risk Reviews found for this entity.


---

• IIG / RFI Response (If any):

No IIG/RFI raised or pending for this case.


---

Final Recommendation / Conclusion:

The transactions are consistent with the stated line of business, and both focal and counterparty entities are clearly identified with legitimate IT service operations.
The triggered DS for Recurring Originator and Beneficiary is fully mitigated, as the repeated payments reflect standard business transactions.
While high-risk jurisdictions were involved, there is no evidence of suspicious activity, and the exposure is justified based on business requirements.
Overall, no anomalies or concerns identified, and the case may be closed with no further action recommended.
