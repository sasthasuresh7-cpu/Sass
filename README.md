Detection Scenarios (List Triggered DS):
The detection scenario triggered in this case is FTN – Recurring Originator and Beneficiary, as the focal individual has conducted repeated transactions where she acted as both the originator and beneficiary, with 100% of the transactions classified as interpersonal/self-transfers.
Justification for CP Selection (If any):
Counterparty selection is justified as the transactions represent self-to-self transfers, with no involvement of unrelated third parties. The counterparty relationship is clearly established as personal accounts held by the focal individual.
Profile – Main Entity & Counterparty details/Relationship:
The focal individual, Luiza Karolina Rosinska, is identified as working as Chief Risk Officer at CIMB Bank Philippines, indicating a senior professional background in the banking and risk management domain. The counterparty accounts involved in the transactions are personal accounts held by the focal individual, confirming a legitimate self-relationship.
Transaction Analysis / Trend & Pattern:
Between 29 September 2025 and 24 October 2025, the focal individual conducted transactions amounting to USD 87,000. The transactions exhibit a consistent pattern of interpersonal/self-fund transfers, with no unusual structuring or third-party involvement observed.
The OBI references indicate purposes such as “savings for retirement” and “SHD and savings fund transfer”, which clearly establish the intent and legitimacy of the transactions.
Red Flags (If any):
The transactions involve high-risk jurisdictions, namely the Philippines and Thailand. However, the focal individual’s professional profile is well-established, and the purpose of the transactions is clearly identified through the OBI references. It is common for individuals to maintain and transfer funds between personal accounts across multiple jurisdictions; therefore, no material red flag is identified.
Watchlist Screening (Accuity / Kharon / World Check) & Adverse hits (If any):
Watchlist screening was conducted, and no adverse or relevant hits were identified.
Prior RR (If any):
No prior risk reviews are identified for the focal individual.
IIG/RFI response (If any):
Not applicable.
Final Recommendation / Conclusion:
Based on the established profile of the focal individual, the clear identification of transaction purpose through OBI references, and the legitimate nature of the self-to-self fund transfers, the triggered detection scenario is considered mitigated. No indicators of suspicious activity are observed, and the case may be closed as risk mitigated in line with a risk-based approach.
