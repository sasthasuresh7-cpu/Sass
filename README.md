The Focal Entity (FE) is identified as Mohammed Ali H H Al Adba, a Qatar national, maintaining an account with Qatar Islamic Bank (QA), Doha, Qatar. As per available records, the FE’s line of business and business source are unidentified, and no prior risk review cases have been noted for the individual, indicating that this is the first instance of alert generation. During the review period from 29 September 2025 to 28 October 2025, the FE conducted a total of four transactions amounting to USD 42,379.32, all classified as 100% interpersonal transfers. The transactions were denominated in USD and involved the FE acting as both originator and beneficiary, with no third-party involvement identified. The OBI references clearly state the purpose of the transfers as rent or other property expenses, travel expenses, medical expenses, and tourist-related travel expenses, which establishes a legitimate and transparent rationale for the fund movements. The transaction behavior is consistent with personal financial activity and aligns with the FE’s profile, where such transfers are common for managing living, travel, and medical expenses. The detection scenario FTN – Recurring Originator and Beneficiary was triggered solely due to the repetitive nature of the interpersonal transfers; however, this behavior is assessed as non-unusual for an individual, particularly when transferring funds for personal use. No adverse information, suspicious patterns, or unexplained fund flows were identified during the review, and the transaction amounts remain reasonable in the context of personal expense-related transfers. Considering the clear identification of the FE, the consistency of transaction behavior with the individual’s profile, the explicit purpose mentioned in the OBI references, and the absence of prior adverse history, the DS trigger is assessed as adequately mitigated, and the activity does not present any material financial crime risk. Accordingly, the case may be closed under a risk-based approach, subject to ongoing routine monitoring for any future deviations or unusual patterns.
