During the review period, a total of nine transactions were identified between 18 July 2025 and 19 December 2025, amounting to an aggregate value of USD 3,501,040.57. The Open Banking Information (OBI) references clearly specify the exact purpose of each transaction, providing sufficient transparency on the nature and intent of the fund movements. The transactions are primarily associated with the focal group entities, FATHOPES TRADING PTE LTD / FATHOPES ENERGY SDN BHD, and are consistent with their established business operations and revenue profile. Although the cumulative transaction value is high, the amount is assessed to be within the overall revenue-earning capacity of the entities and aligns with their scale of operations. Accordingly, the high transaction value does not raise any concern, as the purpose is clearly identified through OBI references and the activity remains commensurate with the entities’ financial capacity and business model.
