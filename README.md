 AML or financial crime risk concerns.


From the entity’s review, the transactions identified are internal, own-account transfers, with 100% of the funds moving between accounts held by the same entity. The transaction purpose, as indicated by the OBI reference, relates to post-dated cheque (PDC) payments, suggesting structured settlement of obligations in line with agreed payment terms. Such movements are consistent with routine treasury and cash-flow management practices, including the scheduling of payments across different accounts and jurisdictions. No third-party involvement has been identified in this activity. Based on the nature, pattern, and stated purpose of the transactions, the recurring payments do not present any material concern from the entity’s perspective.


CEVA Management GmbH, Switzerland, is a group entity within the CEVA Logistics network primarily engaged in providing centralized management, administrative, and financial support services to affiliated CEVA companies worldwide. Its role is not operational logistics but rather corporate governance, financial oversight, strategic coordination, and internal service support for group entities. CEVA Egypt LLC, on the other hand, is an operational arm of the CEVA Group engaged in providing end-to-end logistics and supply chain solutions within Egypt, including freight forwarding, transportation, warehousing, and distribution services to customers. The business relationship between these two entities is intra-group in nature, where CEVA Management GmbH provides management direction, financial planning, compliance framework, and reporting support to CEVA Egypt LLC, enabling it to efficiently carry out local logistics operations in alignment with global CEVA standards. This structure reflects a typical multinational logistics group model where centralized management functions support local operational entities to ensure uniform governance, financial control, and seamless delivery of logistics services across regions.


The transactions under review represent 100% inter-company/group transfers between CEVA Management GmbH and another CEVA group entity, indicating an internal movement of funds within the CEVA Logistics corporate structure rather than a third-party commercial payment. A total of 5 transactions were executed on 30-Oct-2025 in USD, amounting to USD 360,000. The fund flow reflects internal financial settlements consistent with the role of CEVA Management GmbH as a group management and financial services entity providing centralized support to operational CEVA units. Given the nature of the entities involved, the currency used, and the inter-company classification, the transactions appear to be aligned with routine internal allocations, cost sharing, management service charges, or financial adjustments carried out within the group framework. No adverse indicators are observed apart from the system-generated red flag, and the activity is consistent with expected intra-group financial coordination within a multinational logistics organization.
