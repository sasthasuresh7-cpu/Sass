The focal individual has been positively identified through the LexisNexis report. As per the available information, the focal maintains a reported household income of USD 119,588 and owns a residential property valued at approximately USD 545,936, with multiple mortgages recorded, indicating established financial exposure and credit activity. The individual has several business associations, of which only a limited number were selected for detailed review. The focal is employed as a Chief Executive Officer in multiple entities, including Dewan Enterprise Inc., Dewan Foundation Inc., and SBIT Inc., which supports the presence of diversified income streams and business-related financial activity. During the review period from 25 August to 9 September, the focal remitted a total amount of USD 488,650. Although the aggregate transaction value appears elevated, considering the focal’s household income, property holdings, mortgage profile, and active business involvement, the risk associated with higher-value transactions is reasonably mitigated. Additionally, the transactions consist of 100% interpersonal transfers, and the Originator to Beneficiary Information (OBI) clearly specifies the purpose of the transactions, further supporting transaction transparency. The detection scenario for FTN – Recurring Originator and Beneficiary was triggered due to repeated interpersonal transfers; however, such activity is common for individuals, particularly where relationships and purposes are clearly established. The involvement of a high-risk jurisdiction, Bangladesh, was also noted; however, the counterparty has been identified, and the OBI references clearly outline the transaction purpose. The mere presence of a high-risk jurisdiction, in isolation, does not constitute a concern, as it is common for individuals to reside in or maintain accounts within such jurisdictions. Based on the holistic assessment of customer profile, transaction behavior, financial capacity, and available corroborative information, the identified risks are considered mitigated. Accordingly, the case is recommended for closure as risk-irrelevant at this stage.
