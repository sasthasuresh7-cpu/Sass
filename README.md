The focal individual is identified as Farron Ager / Farron Jesse Ager.
Based on available information, the individual’s profile cannot be conclusively verified through public domain searches. It is, however, common for private individuals to have limited public visibility. Limited details suggest the focal may be a student-focused professional with over 10 years of involvement in ESL (English as a Second Language) education.
All transactions observed — 100% — are interpersonal transfers.
The focal has conducted five transactions between 26 September 2025 and 15 October 2025, with a cumulative value of USD 13,919.58, which is considered low.
Historical transaction analysis shows similar transfer patterns to the same counterparties, indicating consistency and supporting the legitimacy of the activity.
The OBI references clearly outline the stated purposes of the transfers, aligning with the transactional behaviour observed.
This is the first time the focal has triggered a case.
The Detection Scenario triggered is FTN – Recurring Originator and Beneficiary, due to the frequency of transfers. However, since all transactions are interpersonal, low value, supported by OBI narratives, and consistent with historic behaviour, the DS is considered mitigated.
No adverse media or red flags were identified.
Conclusion:
Based on the information reviewed, the transactions are aligned with expected behaviour, within financial capacity, and raise no AML concerns.
The case is recommended for closure as risk irrelevant at this time.
