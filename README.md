 AML or financial crime risk concerns.


From the entity’s review, the transactions identified are internal, own-account transfers, with 100% of the funds moving between accounts held by the same entity. The transaction purpose, as indicated by the OBI reference, relates to post-dated cheque (PDC) payments, suggesting structured settlement of obligations in line with agreed payment terms. Such movements are consistent with routine treasury and cash-flow management practices, including the scheduling of payments across different accounts and jurisdictions. No third-party involvement has been identified in this activity. Based on the nature, pattern, and stated purpose of the transactions, the recurring payments do not present any material concern from the entity’s perspective.
