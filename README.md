The DS for FTN Recurring Originator and Beneficiary was triggered as the focal entity has made multiple transfers within the period 04 September 2025 to 23 September 2025 to the same counterparty, Zerco Gida Sanayi LTD STI, amounting to USD 150,000.00 across three transactions. Upon reviewing the counterparty through public-domain sources such as ImportGenius, Zerco Gida Kuruyemis Baharat Sanayi is identified as a Turkey-based supplier engaged in the manufacturing, processing, and export of dried nuts, dried fruits, and spices, which aligns with the focal entity’s line of business and commercial purpose. Although Turkey is flagged as a high-risk jurisdiction, this does not raise additional concern in this case because both entities are clearly identified, and a legitimate and ongoing business relationship is established between them. The recurring nature of the payments is consistent with regular commercial settlements to a known overseas supplier, and no anomalies or unusual patterns are observed beyond the expected trading activity. In view of the above, the DS is fully mitigated, as the transactions reflect normal business operations with a verified counterparty and fall within the expected line of business of the focal entity.
