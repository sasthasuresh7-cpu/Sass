The focal entity, Arda Basgezer, could not be located through public domain sources.
The counterparty, Rosemary Kay Csilla, is also not identifiable in the public domain.
A total of four transactions amounting to USD 10,500 were observed.
The OBI reference consistently states “to spouse’s account,” clearly indicating the intended purpose.
Historical review confirms that similar payments have been made previously to the same counterparty with the same OBI reference, demonstrating transactional consistency and suggesting an ongoing personal or familial financial support arrangement.
This is the first alert triggered on this relationship.
The detection scenario “FTN Recurring Originator and Beneficiary” was triggered due to repeated transfers; however, the low transaction values, supported OBI purpose, and historical consistency mitigate the scenario risk.
One transaction involves Turkey, a high-risk jurisdiction. However, given the personal nature of the transfers and the OBI explicitly indicating a spousal account, the jurisdictional risk is reasonably mitigated. It is common for individuals to maintain accounts or remit funds to family in their location or country of residence.
Conclusion
Based on transactional behaviour, supported purpose, low value, and absence of adverse indicators, no suspicious activity is identified at this stage.
Accordingly, the case is recommended for closure as risk irrelevant at this juncture
