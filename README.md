Detection Scenarios (List Triggered DS):
The alert was generated due to multiple outbound remittance transactions conducted by the focal entity within a defined period, indicating recurring international payments to the same counterparty.
Justification for CP Selection (If any):
The counterparty, JCC International Footwear Co. Ltd, was selected for review as it is the beneficiary of multiple outbound USD transactions from the focal entity. The review was conducted to assess the legitimacy of the business relationship and the nature of payments.
Profile – Main Entity & Counterparty Details / Relationship:
The focal entity, Dolls Kill Inc, is a US-based online retail company operating in the public domain. The company is engaged in the sale of apparel, footwear, accessories, and related consumer products through its online platform.
The counterparty, JCC International Footwear Co. Ltd, is located in Hong Kong and operates as a wholesale trader of footwear. The relationship between the focal entity and the counterparty appears to be a legitimate business relationship, where the counterparty acts as a supplier/vendor for footwear products sold by the focal entity. The nature of the relationship aligns with the focal entity’s stated line of business.
Transaction Analysis / Trend & Pattern:
A total of 8 outbound transactions amounting to USD 350,000 were identified during the review period from 19-Sep-2025 to 05-Nov-2025. All transactions were executed in USD and remitted from the focal entity’s account to the counterparty’s account held with Standard Chartered Bank, Hong Kong.
The transactions exhibit a consistent pattern of recurring payments, which is reasonable and expected in the context of ongoing trade activities. The remittance remarks indicate invoice payments/remittances, supporting the view that the transactions are trade-related. No unusual structuring, abrupt value spikes, or deviations from expected business behavior were observed.
Red Flags (If any):
No material red flags were identified. While the transactions involve a foreign jurisdiction (Hong Kong), the country is commonly used for international trade activities, and the transaction pattern remains consistent with legitimate wholesale business operations.
Watchlist Screening (Accuity / Kharon / World Check) & Adverse Hits (If any):
Watchlist screening conducted on both the focal entity and the counterparty did not return any adverse hits or negative media. No sanctions, PEP, or other high-risk indicators were identified.
Prior RR (If any):
No prior Risk Reviews or alerts were identified for the focal entity as per ECM records.
IIG/RFI Response (If any):
Not applicable, as sufficient information was available to complete the review and no additional clarification was required.
Final Recommendation / Conclusion:
Based on the review of the entity profiles, transaction behavior, stated business activities, and screening results, the transactions appear to be legitimate business-related payments consistent with the focal entity’s retail operations. The counterparty relationship is reasonable and supported by the nature of the transactions. No suspicious activity has been identified.
Accordingly, the alert is recommended to be closed as no AML concern is observed.
